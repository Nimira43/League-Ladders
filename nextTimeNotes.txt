The Plan Going Forward: Ladder Refactor, Part II

1. ðŸŒ€ Implement Drag-and-Drop Logic
Lift divisions into React state (likely in DivisionGrid)

Pass state + setter to Ladder so it can update team order

Use onDragStart, onDragOver, onDrop to handle movement

Ensure teams can move between divisions and reorder within

2. ðŸ“¦ Persist State 
Add localStorage or sessionStorage to preserve ladder state across refreshes

Optionally: export/import JSON for saving and loading ladder configurations

3. ðŸŽ¨ Polish UI & Interactions
Add hover/active states to TeamItem (e.g. hover:scale-105, active:opacity-80)

Animate drag/drop transitions with Tailwind or Framer Motion

Add visual cues for drop targets (e.g. border-dashed, bg-opacity)

4. ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation
Ensure zone breaks render correctly after reordering

Validate that team colours and labels persist post-drop

Add dev-only debug panel to inspect current divisions state
